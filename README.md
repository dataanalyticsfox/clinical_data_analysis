# Health data challenge

1. Spend some time exploring the data and show or discuss what you find. What are the types of data quality issues will you have to consider? 

2. Medical Device Company A comes to us and wants to find out how many patients with diabetes are under 75, have the following diagnostic codes: 408850009, 232063007, 232053004, a total Cholesterol reading between 185 and 230, and a diastolic blood pressure reading of over 100. How many patients meet this criteria? How would you report this information back to Medical Device Company A?

3. Pharma Co. Z has a product on the market to prevent heart attacks. They want to study patients who complain of signs of heart attacks to their doctors. Specifically, they are interested in knowing how many patients complain of pain, fluttering, pressure, or tightness in their chest have that documented in the notes of their record. Write code for and provide counts of how many unique patients match this criteria. Write a short summary to the client communicating what you did. If we wanted to recommend a more advanced text search, what would you suggest doing? 

4. Pharma Co. Z has a couple of follow-up questions after seeing the results of their  previous inquiry. 

How many patients are male, have diagnoses: 232065000 or H35.52, and the physician noted the patient complains of pain, fluttering, pressure or tightness in their chest? 
How many patients with either of the two diagnoses might have experienced those symptoms, but cannot be confirmed using this data? Write 1-2 sentences for Pharma Co. Z about why this might be the case. 

5. Assess the distribution of TenYearCHD among men and women. Run a statistical test to determine significance and interpret the results. 

6. Is there a relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the prevalence of diabetes? Run a statistical test to determine significance, interpret the results and create a visualization to display this.
